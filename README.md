# Do Not Crash

Simple plugin for GTA 3, VC and SA that puts the player into any vehicle they collide with while driving.

If the colliding vehicle has a driver, the driver of that vehicle will also swap to your old vehicle.

# To Do

- Restore ped tasks in 3 and VC
- Add support for peds
  - In 3 and VC just change ped models and swap positions
  - In SA that may be more complex with CJ clothing etc.
- Add support for dynamic (moveable) objects
  - Controlled like in prophunt
  - Player dies if object is breakable and breaks
  - Make non-controlled breakable objects unbreakable
- Swap between peds, vehicles and objects respectively
- Add config (INI, maybe ingame)
